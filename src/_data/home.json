  "body": "A dedicated free resource (paid services entirely optional) for the holistic practitioners, guides, and centers to ascend their online presence, build or grow their business or client base, and learn to manage all aspects of the business. \n\nFrom branding, website, graphics, social media, scheduling, payments, event listings, client management, contracts/waivers, automation, creating paid content, launching a podcast, how to hold online video meetings, and suggestions for improving in-person events using technology. \n\nMy goal is to increase global consciousness by empowering holistic workers and centers. As much as possible, I provide free information and options. Paid/premium options are available for some offerings (I've helped clients with websites for over 10 years now), and I very much appreciate any feedback and referrals to this page. If you have any ideas on how to improve this page to be more helpful, please let me know as it's a living resource."
